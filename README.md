- [Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://github.com/khaophuthaipch/EAI6000/blob/master/PimKhaophuthai_EAI6000_Assignment1(Titanic).ipynb) - Predicting who will survive the sinking with Random Forest

- [Boston Food Establishment Dashboard in Tableau](https://github.com/khaophuthaipch/Food_Inspection_Dashboard-Tableau-/blob/master/README.md) - An interactive dashboard allowing user to visually explore the data in greater level of analysis.

# Machine Learning 
- [Disaster tweets classification. Real or not?](https://github.com/khaophuthaipch/EAI6000/blob/master/EAI6000_Presentation_FinalProject.ipynb) - A collborative project to classify disaster tweets whether it is real or not using recurrent neural network (LSTM and BERT). Applied word embedding and GloVe.

- [FMINST classification with linear models](https://github.com/khaophuthaipch/EAI6000/blob/master/PimKhaophuthai_EAI6000Assignment2%20-%20Classification.ipynb) - Classification of fashion data set from MNIST using linear model namely LogisticRegression, LinearSVC, and KNN. This is a practice notebook to get familiar with building model including searching for hyperparameter and visualizing coefficient plots

- [FMINST classification with tensorflow](https://github.com/khaophuthaipch/EAI6000/blob/master/PimKhaophuthai_Week3_Lab_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb) - Classification of different types of cloths using tensorflow; Simple Neural Network with error analysis.

- [Street view house number classification ](https://github.com/khaophuthaipch/EAI6000/blob/master/Assignment_3_Street_View_House_Numbers.ipynb) - Detect and classify digits from street view house number image. 32-by-32 RGB images centered around a single digit of a house number appearing in Google Street View. Many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides. It consists of 10 classes, 1 for each digit.
